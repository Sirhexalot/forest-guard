This project is a Taiga Dashboard for managers to see who is doing what on different Taiga projects. 

## Start the project

### For development

You will need yarn installed on your computer and an accessible Taiga instance. The Taiga API url should be passed in the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable like so :

```
